                    There are two articles about the same event of each case, called "recalled story", and "retold
                    story".<br />

                        <div>After 2-3 months, the authors are asked to re-tell the events, providing them with the

                    There are two parts in this lebeling work: Span Labeling & Relation tagging
                    <h5>Outline</h5>
                    <div>
                        1. Click 'View Instructions' and read the describtions in this page.<br>
                        2. According to the detail rule below, start to label the spans.<br>
                        3. Click "Start Relation Tagging" and start tagging the relations.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- There would pop up a floating box which allow you to tag the relation
                        via
                        that.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The tagging result would be listed in the below.

                            Life event means the sentence contains personal experiences about

                        <div style="flex: none;">2. Tag the relations&nbsp;:&nbsp;</div>
                        <div>Tag the relations between the spans in the recalled and retold stories with three types,
                            including <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Match", "Conflict" and "Add"</span>.
                            <div style="display: flex;">
                                <div style="flex: none;font-weight: bold;">Match&nbsp;:&nbsp;</div>
                                <div>The spans from both recalled story and retold story describe the same thing,
                                    and there are no conflicts between each other.<br>
                                    <span style="color: red;">Notice</span>: No matter which span describe in better
                                    detail, we only concern that the spans are describing the same life event.<br>
                                    Take the green box of below picture for example, both spans from recalled and retold
                                    story describe the life event about they found the gorillas, so that we tagged the
                                    relation of these spans as "match".
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <div style="display: flex;">
                                <div style="flex: none;font-weight: bold;">Conflict&nbsp;:&nbsp;</div>
                                <div>In contrast to "Match", "Conflict" means the events described in the spans from
                                    both recalled story and retold story are inconsistent.<br>
                                    Take the red box of below picture for example, the month of the date of same life
                                    event is totally different, so that we tagged the relation of this ids pair as
                                    "conflict".
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <div style="display: flex;">
                                <div style="flex: none;font-weight: bold;">Added&nbsp;:&nbsp;</div>
                                <div>If the life event only appeared in the retold story, please tag the spans with
                                    "Added". In this case, only the spans in the retold story need to be tagged.<br>
                                    Take the blue box of below picture for example, the time information of the life
                                    event only appeared in the retold story, so that we tagged the relation as "added".
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                Note that:
                                <div style="display: flex;">
                                    <div style="flex: none;">1&nbsp;.&nbsp;</div>
                                    <div>The mapping between the spans in the recalled and retold stories may be
                                        one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many to denote the relation
                                        types of "Match" and "Conflict".<br>
                                        For example,<br>
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;- one-to-many means one span in the recalled may be mapped to
                                        multiple spans in the retold story.<br>
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;- Many-to-one means multiple spans in the recalled may be mapped to
                                        one span in
                                        the retold story.
                                    </div>
                                </div>

                                    <div style="flex: none;">2&nbsp;.&nbsp;</div>
                                    <div>All labeled spans of retold story should be tagged at least one relation type.
                                    </div>
