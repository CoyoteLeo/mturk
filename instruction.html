                    There are two parts in this labeling work: Span Labeling and Relation Tagging
                    <h5>Outline</h5>
                    <div>
                        1. Click 'View Instructions' and read the descriptions on this page.<br>
                        2. According to the detail rule below, start to label the spans.<br>
                        3. Click "Start Relation Tagging" and start tagging the relations.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- There would pop up a floating box that allows you to tag the relation
                        via that.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The tagging result would be listed below.

                        <div>Select the spans of <span style="font-weight:bold">life events</span> of the author in
                            recalled and retold story, which are related to the event of the summary, i.e. Any 5W(When,
                            Who, Where, What, Why) about the event.
                            <h5>WHAT is Span:</h5>
                            The <span style="font-weight:bold">tightest</span> span in the sentence that related to the
                            life event, i.e. the span is a sub-sequence of a sentence and there may be
                            multiple spans in one sentence. e.g.<br>
                            <span class="example_sent">I can't exactly remember the day but I believe <span
                                    style="background-color: yellow;">it was either
                                    April or May or maybe June.</span></span>-> Only select the span that relate to the
                            life event.<br>
                            <span class="example_sent"><span style="background-color: yellow;">When we walked in there

                                    insect/reptile section of the zoo and saw many exotic

                            one sentence, but the subject only appear once. In this case, you can just select the whole
                            sentence. However, in the relation tagging part(detail listed below), you should consider
                            that there are two
                            different life event and tagging to different relations.

                                    Take the green box of below picture for example, both spans from recalled and
                                    retold storys describe the life event about they found the gorillas so that we
                                    tagged the relation of these spans as "match".
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <div style="display: flex;">
                                <div style="flex: none;font-weight: bold;">Conflict&nbsp;:&nbsp;</div>
                                <div>In contrast to "Match", "Conflict" means the events described in the spans from
                                    both recalled story and retold storys are inconsistent.<br>
                                    Take the red box of below picture for example, the month of the same life
                                    event from recalled and retold story are different, so that we tagged the relation
                                    of this ids pair as "conflict".
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <div style="display: flex;">
                                <div style="flex: none;font-weight: bold;">Added&nbsp;:&nbsp;</div>
                                <div>If the life event only appeared in the retold story, please tag the spans with
                                    "Added". In this case, only the spans in the retold story need to be tagged.<br>
                                    Take the blue box of below picture for example, the time information of the life
                                    event only appeared in the retold story, so that we tagged the relation as "added".
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                Note that:
                                <div style="display: flex;">
                                    <div style="flex: none;">1&nbsp;.&nbsp;</div>
                                    <div>
                                        Each span represents a life event or part of description of life event.
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <div style="display: flex;">
                                    <div style="flex: none;">2&nbsp;.&nbsp;</div>
                                    <div>The mapping between the spans in the recalled and retold stories may be
                                        one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many to denote the relation
                                        types of "Match" and "Conflict".<br>
                                        For example,<br>
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;- one-to-many means one span in the recalled may be mapped to
                                        multiple spans in the retold story.<br>
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;- Many-to-one means multiple spans in the recalled may be mapped to
                                        one span in
                                        the retold story.
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <div style="display: flex;">
                                    <div style="flex: none;">3&nbsp;.&nbsp;</div>
                                    <div>All labeled spans of retold story should be tagged at least one relation type.
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <div style="display: flex;">
                                    <div style="flex: none;">4&nbsp;.&nbsp;</div>
                                    <div>Because the time gap between recalled story and retold story is greater than
                                        half year, the relative time duration may be different, but relation might be
                                        "Match". (Row1: relative time description; Row2: absolute time description)
